# Formula 1 Race Strategy Analysis and Visualisations

*Project Start Date: May 2023*

This GitHub repository contains a collection of scripts for analysing and visualising Formula 1 race strategy and laptime data. I have developed these tools to facilitate my own race strategy analysis. This project aims to provide insights into race strategies employed by Formula 1 teams and aid in understanding laptime patterns throughout the race.

See the full list of my *"What Made the Difference?"* strategy reports [here](/What%20Made%20The%20Difference/).

## Features

Using either MATLAB or the Dash and plotly Python modules, the scripts in this repository produce interactive graphs that are viewed in MATLAB or on Dash apps.

These scripts are able to:
- Import and process FIA official race data, including full race laptime information for drivers and teams of interest.
- Generate visualisations to show race strategy and laptime data as appropriate.
- Display data visualisations in the interactive MATLAB user interface, or on an interactive Dash app in the case of the Python scripts.

## Blogs & Reports: *What Made the Difference?*

- Concise summaries of core strategic decisions that effect race results.
- Identifying specific tyre stints that led to the final race outcome.
- Hypotheses as to potential external factors or alternative decisions could have impacted the race significantly.

## Introduction to Race Strategy

- **Tyre Management:** Managing tyre degradation and choosing the right tyre compounds for different stages of the race is essential. Teams need to determine the optimal time for pit stops to minimise time loss and maintain competitive lap times.

- **Fuel Strategy:** Strategically managing fuel consumption throughout the race is vital. Calculating the optimal fuel load, considering factors such as race distance, car performance, and anticipated safety car periods, helps teams maximise speed while minimizing weight.

- **Overtaking Opportunities:** Identifying and capitalising on overtaking opportunities is crucial for gaining track position. Teams analyse circuit layouts and their features, such as DRS zones, to devise strategic plans for overtaking competitors effectively. On circuits like Monaco, track position is key since overtaking on track is extremely difficult!

- **Pit Stop Strategy:** Carefully planning pit stops and their timing can significantly impact race outcomes. Factors such as traffic, tyre wear, and track position are considered to determine when to pit for fresh tyres, balancing the advantage of improved performance against the potential loss of track position.

- **Safety Car and Virtual Safety Car (VSC):** Reacting to safety car periods or VSC situations can present strategic opportunities. Teams evaluate whether to pit for fresh tyres, take advantage of the neutralized field, or stay out to gain track position.

- **Weather Conditions:** Monitoring and adapting to changing weather conditions is essential. Rain or temperature variations can significantly impact tyre performance and overall race strategy. Teams assess forecasts and adjust their plans accordingly.

- **Race Simulation and Analysis:** Utilizing race simulations and data analysis tools, teams evaluate different strategic options and scenarios before the race. This helps them identify optimal strategies based on various factors like pace, track position, and competitor behavior.

- **Driver Management:** Teams consider driver capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses when devising race strategies. Tailoring the strategy to each driver's style and preferences can yield better performance and increase the chances of success.

- **Competitor Analysis:** Analysing competitor behaviors, strengths, and weaknesses provides insights into their likely strategies. This information helps teams anticipate their rivals' moves and formulate effective counter-strategies.
